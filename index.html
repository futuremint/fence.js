        <h1>fence.js</h1>

<p>A small library to create JSON backed domain models with chainable methods.  Specify which of your model methods are synchronous or asynchronous, and call <code>value()</code> with a callback to get the completed value of your model.  The methods are only executed when you call <code>value()</code>.  This is useful if you have multiple methods that may asynchronously call a database, and you just want to "do something" with a model (or collection of models) and proceed with the result (like rendering a web page).</p>

<p>It is written in Coffeescript, but .js files are included, so no knowledge of Coffeescript is necessary.  </p>

<p>To run the example of how to use the model:
<code>
cd examples
node user-usage.js
</code> 
See examples/user.coffee or user.js for an example on how to write a model using this library.</p>
