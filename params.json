{"name":"Fence.js","body":"# fence.js\r\n\r\n  A small library to create JSON backed domain models with chainable methods.  Specify which of your model methods are synchronous or asynchronous, and call `value()` with a callback to get the completed value of your model.  The methods are only executed when you call `value()`.  This is useful if you have multiple methods that may asynchronously call a database, and you just want to \"do something\" with a model (or collection of models) and proceed with the result (like rendering a web page).\r\n\r\n  It is written in Coffeescript, but .js files are included, so no knowledge of Coffeescript is necessary.  \r\n  \r\n  To run the example of how to use the model:\r\n```\r\ncd examples\r\nnode user-usage.js\r\n``` \r\nSee examples/user.coffee or user.js for an example on how to write a model using this library.\r\n\r\n## License \r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2011 Dave Woodward &lt;dave@futuremint.com&gt;\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\r\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\r\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\r\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\r\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.","tagline":"A small node.js library for making model objects a thin wrapper around your JSON.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
